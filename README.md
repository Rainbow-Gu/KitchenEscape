# CSC120-FinalProject
## KitchenEscape

This is the final project for **CSC 120 object-oriented programming**. 

Written by ***Rainbow Gu (Smith '26), Michelle Xu (Smith '27)***

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

Our overall approach is to start small from the end and working it back. We first start from creating classes for different objects and then go on to connect the objects and code for results of different user inputs. We also used a lot of time at the start and the end to make sure the logic roughly makes sense.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

We learnt that game design is actually not that easy considering different gaming logics different people have, and sometimes steps we think is logical may not be so for the user (e.g. some users doesn't remember to take object). Furthermore, we learnt about the magnificent switch statement in Java from tutors that made processing the significant amount of user inputs achievable.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?

In the future, we might consider changing the face 'direction' to be turn right/left to make it physically intuitive instead of directly on which direction. We also might implement everything to not be extending Item just to get the assigned class variables working.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

Some additional features may include a time element to the cooking and baking. We might also make this from text game to graphics. Furthermore, we might allow the user to dump the noodle instead of eat it. We might also allow the user to eat the cake and have something else happen.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

The most helpful feedback is from tutor Zihan, who helped us to figure out switch statement and inspired us to put all static class variables in Item class and let everything else extends it. I think it these two suggestions that helped to save us from our misery.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?

I think would be to spend less time on making the key finding process more complicated, because it's difficult to implement.

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
 
 Working in the team together had been a great experience for both of us as we can double check for the others code and remind them about possible flaws. We also benefited from each others' wisdoms in making the game more logical.
